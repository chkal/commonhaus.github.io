[![🗳️ Vote progress](https://www.commonhaus.org/votes/commonhaus/foundation/143.svg)](https://github.com/commonhaus/foundation/pull/143#issuecomment-2075423094 "IC_kwDOKRPTI857tHF2")

It's time to finalize the bylaws! 🎉

To avoid drowning, we'll do these a few at a time, and I'll try to balance reading length.
If you haven't read them in depth, now would be a good time to give them a once over.

We're starting with a few easy ones:

- The preface was added by request to give an overview of all of the parts
- The purpose aligns the Commonhaus Foundation with its status as a 501(c)(6)
- Amendments describes how we will approach amending these bylaws in the future.

What to do:

- If you like it or it looks good to you:
    - Approve the PR
    - **👍 (:+1:)** if it looks good to you
    - **👀 (:eyes:)** if you're "ok" with it (it may not be your favorite)
- If you think it needs discussion or revision
    - Create a review, add your comments and require changes
    - Use the +- button to make a suggestion (instead of just adding a comment).
