It's time to finalize the bylaws! 🎉

To avoid drowning, we'll do these a few at a time, and I'll try to balance reading length.
If you haven't read them in depth, now would be a good time to give them a once over.

We're starting with a few easy ones:

- The preface was added by request to give an overview of all of the parts
- The purpose aligns the Commonhaus Foundation with its status as a 501(c)(6)
- Amendments describes how we will approach amending these bylaws in the future.

What to do:
 
1. Use the +- button to make a suggestion (instead of just adding a comment). 
2. If it looks good to you, approve the review.
