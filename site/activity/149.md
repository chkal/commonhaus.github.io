[![üó≥Ô∏è Vote progress](https://www.commonhaus.org/votes/commonhaus/foundation/149.svg)](https://github.com/commonhaus/foundation/pull/149#issuecomment-2087745125 "IC_kwDOKRPTI858cHZl")

Just the CF Council (and Extended Governance Committee) bylaws this time.

I know I have a concern about electronic/digital participation in lieu of meetings. At the moment (as written) our electronic participation threshold (quorum) is everyone. Not sure how that will scale as we add more projects. 

I think Gavin also noticed that it wasn't necessarily clear if procedures were the same or different for bylaws vs. policies.
