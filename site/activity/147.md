A listing of foundation trademarks (registered or pending/in use).

I've used a footnote to indicate that registered and other marks for projects are used with permission until either a formal fiscal hosting agreement is signed or the bootstrapping period ends. That allowed me to explain once, but reference that explanation next to every mark to which it applied.
