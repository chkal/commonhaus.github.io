[![🗳️ Vote progress](https://www.commonhaus.org/votes/commonhaus/foundation/147.svg)](https://github.com/commonhaus/foundation/pull/147#issuecomment-2093775675 "IC_kwDOKRPTI858zHs7")

A listing of foundation trademarks (registered or pending/in use).

I've used a footnote to indicate that registered and other marks for projects are used with permission until either a formal fiscal hosting agreement is signed or the bootstrapping period ends. That allowed me to explain once, but reference that explanation next to every mark to which it applied.
